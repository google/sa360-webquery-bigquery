# SA360 WebQuery to BigQuery Exporter

## Background
Large SA360 customers want to build custom reports by combining their 1st party data with paid-search data.

The Easiest way to achieve that is by combining the data in BigQuery.
There are two ways to programmatically import SA360 data into BigQuery
1. [API](https://developers.google.com/search-ads/v2/how-tos/reporting)
2. [Web Query](https://support.google.com/searchads/answer/2870738?hl=en)

WebQuery makes reporting easier compared to the API (with less steps), as it allows adding additional entity data (e.g. Business data) in the report, which makes the report simple as compared to an API where this stitching has to be done in a user's program.

### How does it work?
The tool requires the user's credential to extract Reports from SA360 and also send data into BigQuery.

First the system extracts the Report (in XML format) from SA360 and converts it into CSV on the fly (using SAX parsing), this file is then staged (copied) to GCS, followed by calling BQ API to `load` the data into a separate table.

## Usage

### Create Google Cloud Project
1.  [Create]() a Google Cloud Project and enable billing.
1.  [Enable APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=doubleclicksearch,bigquery.googleapis.com,storage.googleapis.com)
1.  Login to your Google Cloud project and generate credentials for an Installed Application ([Details](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2#installed))     
1.  Update `src/resources/client_secrets.json` with Client id and Client secret generated from your Cloud Project.
1.  Set Variables
    ```shell
    export PROJECT_ID="<google-cloud-project-id>"
    export GCS_BUCKET_NAME="<name-of-cloud-storage-bucket>"
    export BIGQUERY_DATASET_NAME="<name-of-dataset>"
    
    export PROJECT_ID="serverless-orchestration"
    export GCS_BUCKET_NAME="sa360Test"
    export BIGQUERY_DATASET_NAME="sa360_dataset"  
    ```

### Create Resources
1.  Create Cloud Storage bucket to stage the reports.
      ```shell      
      gsutil mb -p ${PROJECT_ID} "gs://${GCS_BUCKET_NAME}" 
      ```

1.  Crate BigQuery dataset to store the reports
    ```shell
    bq mk --project_id="${PROJECT_ID}" ${BIGQUERY_DATASET_NAME}
    ```

### Compile and run
1.  Compile and package source code into an executable JAR. 
    ```shell
    gradle clean fatJar
    ```

1.  Create a [Configuration file (csv)](#csv-file-format) with specified headers. (consider `sample-config.csv` as a reference)

1.  Run the jar file as
    ```shell
    # run the JAR file by specifying the configuraiton file as first parameter
    java -jar build/libs/dswqtobq-1.0.2-all.jar <location of configuration CSV file>
    ```
    >  Optionally, copy the jar file to the final executable location `cp build/libs/dswqtobq-1.0.2-all.jar~/`

1.  This will prompt you to Login using your browser and store the credentials for next time, 
  If you are running this application on a VM/terminal, you can copy/paste the URL to your browser and paste the code back on the command line prompt.

    > Ensure that the user has at least **READ** permissions for SA360 and **EDITOR** Permissions for BigQuery.
    
    > You can schedule to run it automatically using cron, after this step.
    
> Running on Google AppEngine or Google Cloud Functions is discouraged as WebQuery files can be quite large._

### CSV File Format
The CSV configuration file must contain following headers, The order does not matter.
*  `gcsBucketName` - The GCS Bucket to be used for staging CSV file for BQ upload.
*  `projectId` - GCP Project Id to use for billing as well as for BQ Table location.
*  `datasetId` - BQ Dataset id/name belonging to given _projectId_.
*  `tableId` - Prefix to be used for the BigQuery Table
*  `webQueryUrl` - SearchAds 360 WebQuery link
